2.3 User Feedback

Positive:
85% satisfaction, with praise for UI (Marketing Site, Client Portal) and LLM flexibility.
Chatbot saved 60% of users’ time on common tasks (e.g., integration setup).
Analytics adopted by 80% of users for decision-making.


Pain Points:
10% reported slow analytics during peak (resolved with Kafka scaling).
5% requested Claude LLM support.
3% noted mobile UI glitches (scheduled for v1.1, August 15, 2025).


Actions Taken:
Released v1.0.1 with critical fixes (chatbot intents, Stripe webhook, dark mode).
Planned v1.1 for mobile UI and minor bugs.
Evaluating Claude LLM for Phase 2.



3. Lessons Learned

Successes:
Turborepo Monorepo: Streamlined development with shared UI/utils, reducing code duplication by 30%.
AI-First Design: LLM flexibility (Llama, GPT, Hugging Face) drove 80% feature adoption, with adapters ensuring seamless integration.
Compliance Early: Embedding GDPR/SOC 2/HIPAA from design phase avoided audit delays.
Blue-Green Deployment: Achieved zero-downtime rollout, validated by 99.95% uptime.


Challenges:
Kafka Scaling: Initial 3 partitions caused lag at 1,500 users; resolved with 6 partitions.
Lesson: Pre-plan partition counts for 3,000+ users.


Chatbot Accuracy: 5% misclassified queries at launch; retraining improved to 91.5%.
Lesson: Allocate more training data pre-launch.


User Feedback: Manual triage slowed response times.
Lesson: Implement AI-driven feedback analysis in Phase 2.




Improvements:
Parallelize Phase 2 UI/UX and development to shorten timeline.
Add automated load tests to CI/CD pipeline for proactive scaling.
Engage compliance auditors earlier for Phase 2 (August 2025).

Risk: Claude LLM integration fails performance tests.
Mitigation: Fallback to existing LLMs; allocate 2 weeks for testing.


Risk: User growth exceeds infrastructure capacity.
Mitigation: Pre-scale PostgreSQL replicas and Kafka partitions by September 2025.


Risk: Compliance audit delays Phase 2.
Mitigation: Engage auditors in August 2025.
