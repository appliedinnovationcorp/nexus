Version: 1.0Date: August 8, 2025 (simulated)Prepared by: SREs, DevOps Engineers, Development Team (Grok, acting as lead)Client: [Your AI Consulting Company]
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This report summarizes the post-launch maintenance and scaling activities for the [AIConsultCo Platform] MVP (Marketing Website and Client Portal) one month after deployment (July 8, 2025). It covers performance monitoring, user feedback, bug fixes, infrastructure scaling, compliance maintenance, and the rollout plan for Phase 2 components (PaaS Core, Employee/Developer Portals, Virtual Data Room, Admin Interface). The platform supports 1,000–10,000 concurrent users, client-selectable LLMs (Llama, GPT, Hugging Face), and complies with GDPR, SOC 2, and HIPAA.
1.2 Scope

Components Maintained:
Marketing Website: Next.js, TailwindCSS, AI-driven blog (Rasa).
Client Portal: FastAPI (backend), React (frontend), Keycloak (auth), PostgreSQL, TensorFlow (analytics), Rasa (chatbot).
Supporting Services: Auth Service, AI Service, Apache Kafka, EventStoreDB.


Activities:
Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry.
Maintenance: Bug fixes, security patches, compliance audits.
Scaling: Kubernetes auto-scaling, Dokku instance additions.
Feedback: In-app surveys, Slack integration.
Phase 2: Initial development and deployment planning.


Environment: Production (Kubernetes on DigitalOcean/AWS EKS, Dokku for SMBs), with Cloudflare CDN.

2. Performance Monitoring
2.1 Metrics (July 8–August 8, 2025)

Uptime: 99.95% (exceeded 99.9% target).
Downtime: 21 minutes (planned maintenance for Kafka partition increase).


User Activity:
Marketing Website: 15,000 monthly visitors, 2,500 lead form submissions.
Client Portal: 1,200 active users (50 enterprises/SMBs, ~24 users each).
Peak Concurrent Users: 1,500 (Client Portal dashboard, July 20, 2025).


API Performance:
Average Latency: 110ms (target: <200ms).
95th Percentile: 180ms.
Error Rate: 0.8% (target: <1%).


AI Performance:
Chatbot (Rasa): 91.5% response accuracy (target: 90%), latency <300ms.
Analytics (TensorFlow): 95.6% accuracy (target: 95%), inference <500ms.
LLM Usage: Llama (60%), GPT (30%), Hugging Face (10%).


Infrastructure:
Kubernetes: 4 nodes (4 CPU, 8GB RAM each), auto-scaled to 6 during peak.
Dokku: 10 SMB instances (100–200 users each).
Kafka: 3 brokers, 6 partitions, 99.99% message delivery.


Monitoring Tools:

2.2 Key Observations

Marketing Website performs well, with high SEO-driven traffic (10% conversion rate on lead forms).
Client Portal sees strong adoption, with 80% of users leveraging AI analytics and chatbot.
LLM switching seamless, but Hugging Face models show slightly higher latency (350ms vs. 300ms for Llama/GPT).
Kafka partition increase resolved minor lag during peak usage.

5. Scaling Strategy
5.1 Current Capacity

Kubernetes: Handles 1,500 concurrent users, scalable to 10,000 with 10 nodes.
Dokku: 10 instances support 1,000 total users (100–200 each).
Database: PostgreSQL primary/replica handles 1,200 active users; sharding planned for 10,000+.
Kafka: 6 partitions support 10,000 events/sec, expandable to 12.

5.2 Scaling Actions

July 20, 2025: Added 2 Kubernetes nodes during peak (1,500 users), auto-scaled back to 4.
July 25, 2025: Added 2 Dokku instances for new SMB clients (200 users).
Planned:
August 15, 2025: Add read replicas to PostgreSQL for analytics queries.
September 1, 2025: Increase Kafka partitions to 12 for 50% user growth (1,800 users).
October 1, 2025: Test sharding for 3,000 users.



5.3 Growth Projections

6 Months (January 2026): 50% growth (1,800 active users, 22,500 monthly visitors).
12 Months (August 2026): 300% growth (3,800 active users, 45,000 visitors).
Infrastructure Needs:
Kubernetes: 8–12 nodes.
Dokku: 20–30 instances.
PostgreSQL: Sharded cluster with 3 replicas.



6. Phase 2 Rollout Plan

7. Risks and Mitigation

Risk: Unexpected traffic spike overwhelms infrastructure.
Mitigation: Auto-scaling rules tested for 3,000 users; add nodes proactively.


Risk: New LLM (e.g., Claude) integration delays Phase 2.
Mitigation: Prioritize existing LLMs; allocate 2 weeks for Claude testing.


Risk: Compliance audit delays Phase 2 rollout.
Mitigation: Engage auditors in September 2025.


Risk: User feedback backlog grows.
Mitigation: Automate feedback triage with AI, prioritize critical issues.



8. Recommendations

Add LLM Option: Test Claude integration by October 2025.
Scale Proactively: Add PostgreSQL replicas by September 15, 2025.
Enhance Feedback: Add AI-driven sentiment analysis to surveys (Phase 2).
Accelerate Phase 2: Parallelize VDR and Admin Interface development.

9. Next Steps

Release v1.1 with bug fixes (August 15, 2025).
Monitor for 50% growth (September 2025).
Begin Phase 2 UI/UX design (August 15, 2025).
