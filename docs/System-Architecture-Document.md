1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the system architecture for an AI-driven web platform for [Your AI Consulting Company], serving SMBs and enterprises with AI enablement, consulting, PaaS, and SaaS offerings. The architecture supports a modular, scalable, and AI-first platform, adhering to Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Hexagonal/Clean Architecture, Microservices, Event-Driven Architecture, 12-Factor App, and MACH principles. It ensures compliance with GDPR, SOC 2, and HIPAA, and leverages Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) tools for enterprise-grade performance.
1.2 Scope
The architecture covers:

Phase 1 (MVP): Marketing Website and Client Portal with AI-driven analytics, NLP chatbots, data integration, and third-party integrations.
Phase 2: PaaS Core, Employee Portal, Developer Portal, Virtual Data Room (VDR), and Admin Interface.
Key Requirements:
Scalability for 1,000â€“10,000 concurrent users (MVP), up to 1M+ post-launch.
AI-first design with client-selectable LLMs for predictive analytics, NLP, and AutoML.
Compliance with GDPR, SOC 2, HIPAA, and EU AI Act.
Modular monorepo with plug-and-play components.
Database and deployment platform agnostic.



2. System Overview
2.1 High-Level Architecture
The platform follows a Hexagonal/Clean Architecture with microservices, ensuring modularity and separation of concerns. It uses an Event-Driven Architecture with Event Sourcing for real-time processing and auditability. The system is deployed on a cloud-native infrastructure (Kubernetes) with database-agnostic connectivity (PostgreSQL primary).
Components:

Marketing Website: Public-facing, Next.js-based, with AI-driven content generation.
Client Portal: React-based, with FastAPI backend, AI analytics, and integrations.
Employee Portal: HR and internal tools (Phase 2).
Developer Portal: API access and key management (Phase 2).
VDR: Secure document sharing on a subdomain (Phase 2).
Admin Interface: Backend management (Phase 2).
PaaS Core: MLOps, serverless computing, and data integration (Phase 2).
SaaS Apps: Industry-specific AI applications (Phase 2).

Marketing: Content management, lead generation.
Client Management: User accounts, organizations, teams, projects.
PaaS Core: AI model development, MLOps, data integration.
VDR: Document sharing, investor access.
Admin: Site-wide management.


Aggregates:
User (Client Portal): Manages accounts, profiles, dashboards.
Document (VDR): Handles files, permissions, audit trails.
Model (PaaS): Manages AI model lifecycle.



2.3 Microservices Architecture

Services:
Marketing Service: Handles blog, case studies, CTAs.
Client Service: Manages user accounts, dashboards, integrations.
Auth Service: Keycloak for SSO, MFA, and API key management.
AI Service: TensorFlow/PyTorch for analytics, Rasa for chatbots, client-selected LLMs (e.g., Llama, GPT, via API).
Data Service: Apache Spark for data processing, PostgreSQL for storage.
VDR Service: Document management, blockchain integration (Phase 2).


Communication:
REST/GraphQL APIs (FastAPI, Hasura).
Event-driven via Apache Kafka for asynchronous updates.



3. Technical Design
3.1 Frontend

Framework: Next.js (server-side rendering, static generation), React (component-based UI).
Styling: TailwindCSS for responsive, toggleable light/dark themes.
Features:
Marketing Site: SEO-optimized, inspired by https://markovate.com.
Client Portal: Customizable dashboards, inspired by Supabase/GitHub.
VDR: Intuitive UI with OCR search, Q&A module (Phase 2).


Tools: Penpot for wireframes, Turborepo for monorepo.

3.2 Backend

Framework: FastAPI for REST/GraphQL APIs, Node.js for real-time features.
Authentication: Keycloak for SSO, MFA, and API key management.
APIs:
OpenAPI/Swagger for developer portal.
Integrations with Slack, Salesforce, Stripe, Zapier.


Event-Driven:
Apache Kafka for event streaming (e.g., UserSignedUp, DocumentUploaded).
EventStoreDB for Event Sourcing (state reconstruction, audit trails).


AI Integration:
TensorFlow/PyTorch for predictive analytics and AutoML.
Rasa for NLP chatbots (90% response accuracy).
H2O.ai for no-code/low-code model deployment.
LLM Flexibility: Clients can select LLMs (e.g., Llama, GPT, Hugging Face models) via API configuration in the Client Portal, with adapters for model inference.



3.3 Data Layer

Database: PostgreSQL (primary), with SQLAlchemy for agnostic connectivity.
Data Processing: Apache Spark for large-scale data cleansing and feature engineering.
Storage: S3-compatible storage (e.g., MinIO) for VDR documents.
Schema:
