Complete Audits: Finalize GDPR/HIPAA external audits before Phase 2.
Monitor Post-Launch: Use Prometheus/Grafana to track real-world performance.

7. Next Steps

Deploy MVP to production (Kubernetes, Dokku for SMBs).
Monitor performance with Prometheus/Grafana.
Begin Phase 2 development (PaaS, Employee/Developer Portals, VDR, Admin).
