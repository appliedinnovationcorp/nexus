Step 7: Post-Launch Maintenance and Scaling

Take on the roles of: SREs, DevOps Engineers, Full-Stack Developers.
    Actions:
        Monitor performance with Prometheus/Grafana, addressing bottlenecks (e.g., latency <200ms).
        Collect user feedback via in-app surveys and analytics (e.g., Apache Superset).
        Roll out Phase 2 components (PaaS, Employee/Developer Portals, VDR, Admin Interface).
        Implement continuous updates via CI/CD, adding new AI features (e.g., industry-specific models).
        Scale infrastructure for 50â€“300% user growth (e.g., 3,000 clients, 125 developers).
        Maintain compliance with regular audits and security patches.
    Deliverable: Maintenance plan, updated features, and scalability reports.
