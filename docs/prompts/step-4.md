Step 4: Development

Take on the roles of: Full-Stack, Back-End, Front-End Developers, Software Engineers.
    Actions:
        Set up a monorepo using Nx or Turborepo for modular development.
        Develop Marketing Site:
            Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation.
            Integrate AI-driven content generation (e.g., Rasa for blog suggestions).
            Implement CTAs, lead magnets, and analytics (e.g., Apache Superset for internal tracking).
        Develop Client Portal:
            FastAPI for REST/GraphQL APIs, Keycloak for authentication (SSO, MFA).
            React (with TailwindCSS) for customizable dashboards and profiles.
            Integrate AI features: NLP chatbots (Rasa), predictive analytics (TensorFlow/PyTorch).
            Enable CRUD operations for organizations, teams, projects, and environments.
            Integrate third-party apps (Slack, Salesforce, Stripe) via APIs and Zapier.
        Develop PaaS Core (Phase 2):
            FastAPI for MLOps pipelines, TensorFlow/PyTorch for model development.
            Serverless computing with OpenFaaS, data integration with Apache Spark.
            No-code/low-code interfaces using NocoBase or similar.
        Develop Employee/Developer Portals (Phase 2):
            Similar tech stack as Client Portal, with role-specific features (e.g., API key management for developers).
        Develop VDR (Phase 2):
            FastAPI for backend, React for frontend.
            Implement document sharing, granular access controls, audit trails, AI automation (e.g., OCR with Tesseract), and blockchain integration (e.g., Hyperledger).
        Develop Admin Interface:
            React-based dashboard for site-wide management, integrated with Keycloak for admin access.
        Use 12-Factor App principles (e.g., configuration via environment variables, stateless services).
        Implement CI/CD with Drone CI for automated testing and deployment.
    Deliverable: Functional MVP code (Marketing Site and Client Portal), initial PaaS core, and test suites.
