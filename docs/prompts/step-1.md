        Create a Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlining features, user stories, and acceptance criteria.
        Prioritize MVP features: Marketing Site (blog, CTAs, lead magnets) and Client Portal (user accounts, dashboards, integrations).
        Select FOSS tools: Next.js (frontend), FastAPI (backend APIs), PostgreSQL (database), Keycloak (authentication), TailwindCSS (styling), TensorFlow/Rasa (AI), Kubernetes (deployment).
        Define compliance requirements (GDPR, SOC 2, HIPAA) and security protocols (256-bit AES, MFA).
Deliverable: PRD, initial architecture diagram, and tech stack proposal.
