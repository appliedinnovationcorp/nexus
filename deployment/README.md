# Cloud Deployment - AWS Infrastructure

This directory contains cloud-agnostic deployment configurations with AWS as the default provider.

## Architecture Overview

### AWS Services Used
- **EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**: Container orchestration
- **RDS (PostgreSQL)**: Primary database with read replicas
- **ElastiCache (Redis)**: Event bus and caching
- **ALB (Application Load Balancer)**: Traffic distribution
- **CloudFront**: CDN for static assets
- **S3**: File storage and static website hosting
- **Route 53**: DNS management
- **ACM**: SSL certificate management
- **CloudWatch**: Monitoring and logging
- **Secrets Manager**: Secure credential storage
- **IAM**: Identity and access management

### Infrastructure Components

#### 1. **Kubernetes Cluster (EKS)**
- Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
- Auto-scaling node groups
- Network policies for security
- RBAC for service accounts

#### 2. **Database Layer**
- RDS PostgreSQL with Multi-AZ
- Read replicas for query optimization
- Automated backups and point-in-time recovery
- Connection pooling with PgBouncer

#### 3. **Caching & Message Queue**
- ElastiCache Redis cluster
- Event bus for microservices communication
- Session storage and API response caching

#### 4. **Load Balancing & CDN**
- Application Load Balancer with SSL termination
- CloudFront for global content delivery
- Route 53 for DNS and health checks

#### 5. **Storage**
- S3 buckets for file uploads and static assets
- Lifecycle policies for cost optimization
- Cross-region replication for disaster recovery

## Deployment Environments

### Development
- Single-node EKS cluster
- Single RDS instance
- Basic monitoring

### Staging
- Multi-node EKS cluster
- RDS with read replica
- Full monitoring and alerting

### Production
- Multi-AZ EKS cluster with auto-scaling
- RDS Multi-AZ with multiple read replicas
- Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting
- Disaster recovery setup

## Security Features

### Network Security
- VPC with private subnets
- Security groups with least privilege
- Network ACLs for additional protection
- VPN/Direct Connect for secure access

### Application Security
- IAM roles for service authentication
- Secrets Manager for credential management
- WAF for application protection
- GuardDuty for threat detection

### Data Security
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Database encryption with KMS
- S3 bucket encryption
- Regular security audits

## Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics
- CloudWatch metrics for all services
- Custom application metrics
- Business KPI dashboards
- Cost monitoring and alerts

### Logging
- Centralized logging with CloudWatch Logs
- Log aggregation from all services
- Log retention policies
- Search and analysis capabilities

### Alerting
- CloudWatch alarms for critical metrics
- SNS notifications for incidents
- PagerDuty integration for on-call
- Automated remediation where possible

## Cost Optimization

### Resource Optimization
- Right-sizing recommendations
- Reserved instances for predictable workloads
- Spot instances for non-critical workloads
- Auto-scaling based on demand

### Storage Optimization
- S3 Intelligent Tiering
- EBS volume optimization
- Database storage auto-scaling
- Lifecycle policies for data archival

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- Automated RDS backups
- S3 cross-region replication
- EKS cluster backup with Velero
- Configuration backup in Git

### Recovery Procedures
- RTO (Recovery Time Objective): 4 hours
- RPO (Recovery Point Objective): 1 hour
- Automated failover procedures
- Regular disaster recovery testing

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**
   - AWS CLI configured
   - kubectl installed
   - Terraform installed
   - Docker installed

2. **Initial Setup**
   ```bash
   # Clone and setup
   cd deployment/terraform
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

3. **Deploy Applications**
   ```bash
   # Deploy to Kubernetes
   cd deployment/kubernetes
   kubectl apply -f namespaces/
   kubectl apply -f secrets/
   kubectl apply -f services/
   ```

4. **Verify Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Check service health
   kubectl get pods -A
   kubectl get services -A
   ```

## Scaling Guidelines

### Horizontal Scaling
- Kubernetes HPA for pod auto-scaling
- EKS node group auto-scaling
- RDS read replica scaling
- ElastiCache cluster scaling

### Vertical Scaling
- Resource limit adjustments
- Instance type upgrades
- Storage capacity increases
- Network bandwidth optimization

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Security patch updates
- Dependency updates
- Performance optimization
- Cost review and optimization

### Automated Tasks
- Backup verification
- Health check monitoring
- Security scanning
- Compliance reporting
