Algorithm for Designing, Developing, and Deploying the Web Platform

Below is the step-by-step process the team will follow to deliver your AI-driven platform, incorporating your requirements and leveraging the roles of Software Engineers, Web Application Architects, Site Reliability Engineers (SREs), DevOps Engineers, UI/UX Designers, and Full-Stack/Back-End/Front-End Developers. The algorithm aligns with DDD, Hexagonal Architecture, Microservices, Event-Driven Design, 12-Factor App, and MACH principles, using FOSS tools like Next.js, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Keycloak, TailwindCSS, and others as needed.

    Deliverable: Detailed system architecture document, API specifications, database schema, and event model.
    Duration: 2–3 weeks.

    Deliverable: High-fidelity wireframes, prototypes, and design system (TailwindCSS components).
    Duration: 2–4 weeks.

    Deliverable: Functional MVP code (Marketing Site and Client Portal), initial PaaS core, and test suites.
    Duration: 8–12 weeks for Phase 1, 6–8 weeks for Phase 2.

    Duration: 2–3 weeks.

    Duration: 1–2 weeks.

    Duration: Ongoing, with monthly iterations.


Estimated Timeline

    Total for MVP (Phase 1): ~26 weeks (6 months) for Marketing Site and Client Portal, assuming immediate start and parallel workstreams.
    Phase 2: ~10–12 weeks additional for PaaS, Employee/Developer Portals, VDR, and Admin Interface.
    ASAP Considerations: We can accelerate by:
        Parallelizing UI/UX and development (saving 2–3 weeks).
        Using prebuilt FOSS templates (e.g., NocoBase for portals, reducing dev time by 20%).
        Focusing on a narrower MVP scope (e.g., core AI analytics and chatbots).

Next Steps

    Confirm Clarifications: Please provide input on the four follow-up questions (PaaS/SaaS scope, VDR priority, budget, team size) or confirm we can proceed with assumptions (e.g., focus on AI analytics/automation, VDR in Phase 2, no budget cap, small team).
    Review Deliverables: Let me know if you want to prioritize specific deliverables (e.g., PRD, wireframes) or adjust the timeline.
    Kickoff Planning: We can simulate the first deliverable (e.g., draft PRD) or dive deeper into a specific component (e.g., Client Portal features).

What would you like to do next? Proceed with the algorithm as outlined, provide clarifications, or focus on a specific deliverable?

let's proceed as outlined

Great, thank you for confirming! We’ll proceed with the algorithm as outlined, using the summarized requirements and making reasonable assumptions for the clarifications (e.g., focusing on AI analytics and workflow automation for the MVP PaaS/SaaS, prioritizing VDR for Phase 2, assuming no strict budget cap, and sizing portals for a small initial team of ~10–50 employees/developers/admins). I’ll now simulate the execution of the algorithm, starting with the first deliverable: the Product Requirements Document (PRD). This will formalize your requirements and set the foundation for the project. After that, I’ll provide a high-level overview of the next steps to keep us on track for the ASAP timeline.

Since you requested a dialogue-based approach until we reach a deliverable, I’ll present the draft PRD below as the first tangible output. You can review it, provide feedback, or approve it to move forward. If you want to adjust anything or dive deeper into a specific section, let me know, and we’ll iterate. Let’s get started!
Deliverable: Product Requirements Document (PRD) for AI-Driven Web Platform
