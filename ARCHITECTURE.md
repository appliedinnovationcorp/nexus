# B2B Platform Ecosystem - Complete Architecture

## Overview

I've implemented a comprehensive **B2B Platform Ecosystem** with microservices backend and microfrontend architecture, featuring:

- **Domain Driven Design (DDD)** with proper bounded contexts
- **Event Sourcing & CQRS** for complete audit trails and scalability
- **Event Driven Architecture** for loose coupling between services
- **Microservices** for independent deployment and scaling
- **Microfrontends** with Module Federation for independent frontend development
- **Database Agnostic** design with PostgreSQL/Supabase as default

## Domain Model
